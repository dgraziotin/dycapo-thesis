	abstract = {The two traditional types of software prototyping methods,
throwaway prototyping and evolutionary prototyping, are compared, and
prototyping's relation to conventional software development is
discussed. Operational prototyping, a method that combines throwaway and
evolutionary prototyping techniques by layering a rapid prototype over a
solid evolutionary base, is described. Operational prototyping's
implications for configuration management, quality assurance, and
general project management are reviewed. The application of operational
prototyping to a prototype ocean surveillance terminal is
presented},
